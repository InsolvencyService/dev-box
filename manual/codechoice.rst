Code Choice
===========

The choice made was *Python*

The following factors were considered in the initial selection;

* Has at least one proven (used for a major commercial website) web framework.
* At least one of the TW/GDS developers has enough experience to coach other people.
* Being able to develop and host on Linux and Windows, due to GDS alpha hosting, and INSS potential beta/live hosting.

This left us with the initial pool of:

* Scala
* Ruby
* Python
* Java
* C#

**Selection criteria applied against each language**

* Ease to learn/learning curve
* Speed of development
* Degree of existing knowledge
* Positive/Negative experiences people in all teams have had working with a language.

Performance was considered but, while the non interpreted languages perform slightly quicker, there isn't a big enough difference for it to affect the choice.

**Scala**

* Initially steep learning curve (possibly too steep for a seven week alpha).
* Speed of development while learning is very low, but can be very rapid for experienced developers (more so than Python, Java, C#. Comparable to Ruby?)
* Enough experience to coach in GDS and TW
* No one mentioned any problems, as long as people don't start abusing features like operator overloading

**Ruby**

* Very similar to Scala for most criteria
* The developers who have used Ruby mentioned three main criticisms;
* It's easy for people to write “bad” code
* People can write code that, while clever, takes a long time to understand
* The naming conventions of the libraries are often not indicative of what their actual purpose is

**Python**

* Fairly even learning curve, and considered by some TW and INSS developers to be the most intuitive of the languages.
* Speed of development is fairly good, while it will increase with experience, it's unlikely to be as rapid as Ruby or Scala.
* Enough experience to coach in GDS and TW
* The main positive with Python is the design principles which favour simplicity, readability, and intuitiveness.

**Java**

* Fairly even learning curve, and most (although not all) INSS developers have some prior experience.
* Speed of development can be slow compared with the other languages
* Enough experience for coaching

**C#**

* Fairly even learning curve, and it's the one INSS have most experience with by a long way. Would still need to learn some new skills, as MVC is a lot more useful for this type of project than the web forms we're used to.
* Speed of development comparable with Python
* Enough experience for coaching were necessary
* Negatives are;

    * It's the only language with large proprietary licensing costs attached
    * Would be missing a unique opportunity to broaden our skills base
