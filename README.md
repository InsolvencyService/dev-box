### Post Install Tasks

- Configure SSH for GIT - Follow this guide (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
  - OK not to bother with a passphrase for alpha (leave blank), will need one for beta
- Clone the repository.  
  - cd to your work in progress folder in git-bash
  - From git-bash: `git clone git@github.com:InsolvencyService/rps-alpha.git`

### Build box, run tests

- Open a new git-bash (windows)/terminal (mac) on and navigate to where you have downloaded or cloned this repo.
- Run `vagrant up`... Vagrant should create a new virtual machine and puppet should install all the needed deps.
- Run `vagrant ssh` to ssh into the newly created virtual machine
- Run `cd /vagrant` to see the files mirrored from your host machine to your VM
- To get the project to run, you'll need to do the following
  - `cd /vagrant/redundancy_payments_alpha/`
  - `mkvirtualenv rps`
  - `workon rps`
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- You should now be able to run `./run_tests.sh` to run the tests or `python start_app.py` to run the server
- Once the server is running, you can access the webpage on (http://localhost:8000/claimant-contact-details)

### More info

- From within your vagrant box, cd to `/vagrant/manual`
- `pip install sphinx`
- Run `make html`
