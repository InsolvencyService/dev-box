GOV.UK Operations Manual
========================

Welcome to the GOV.UK Operations Manual. This is the canonical source for
information on GOV.UK Operations and the GDS Infrastructure & Tools team.

.. note::

   The Operations Manual has recently moved from its previous home on `Google
   Sites`_, and some content may be missing, in the wrong place, or out of date.
   We're working on improving these issues, but please bear with us for the
   moment.

What is this?
=============

The web pages you're viewing are maintained as a Sphinx_ project on `GitHub
Enterprise`_. Anyone can edit the content, and there is a short guide to getting
started:
